`make` should suffice to compile the executable `graphene`, while the script `run` illustrates the options it can take:
```
$ ./graphene --help

./graphene [options]
options:
 L #       length of each side of graphene lattice
 t #       time
 B #       beta
 k #       kappa
 g #       Coulomb strength
 R #       Coulomb self-interaction effective radius
 r #       CG residual
 S #       random number seed
```
