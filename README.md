This repository contains some template code that may be useful to work on algorithms-related exercises for the July 2021 Bad Honnef Physics School, [Methods of Effective Field Theory and Lattice Field Theory](https://www.dpg-physik.de/veranstaltungen/2020/methods-of-effective-field-theory-and-lattice-field-theory).  Eventually model solutions will be added in a separate branch.

## Hybrid Monte Carlo

## Conjugate gradient
